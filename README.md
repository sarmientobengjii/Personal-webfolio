This is my personal portfolio, I initially did this portfolio to send for my job application but it turned out to be good. 
I will be making some more improvements for this portfolio in the future.
**I'm still encountering some bugs regarding API Integration** because my github repositories are not loading dynamically.


I only used **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript** because I'm prioritizing the responsiveness, fast loading, and the simplicity of the portfolio.

**No setup for this one but if you try to hover your mouse cursor on the avatar, it will change/transition.**
